# Module-1-Challenge 
- Using the given code we must meet accessibility standards for SEO and use correct smantic formatting to give the end user a better experiance, and by doing so, we must implement best HTML and CSS practices.

# HTML Changes
------------
- Changed div navigation
- Changed div main
- Changed many general divs to sections
- Changed title to Horiseon
- Made the title linked to the main website page
- Fixed navigation linking as one of them did not redirect to the correct portion of the page
- Added a title to the hero img since there is no way of adding alt text to CSS
Included alt text for:
- SEO image
- Online Reputation Management image
- Social Media Marketing image
- Included alt tags for images as best practice, without discription as the images are more for show then relative to the content
- Remove Closing </img> element and replaced it with /> as img tags don't need closing tags
- Added comments for Deeper understanding
- Included and id for best practice in the benafits divs and changed them to articles
- Defined footer div

# CSS Changes
-----------
- Added quotations to font Calibri
- Changed div to nav for the navigation type selector
- Combined .header nav and .header nav ul for simplicity
Removed multiple non-necessary classes and combined .benafits-lead .benafits-brand and .benafits.cost together since they are the same and I just used the original - classification of benafits
- Same as above but with .benafits-lead h3 .benafits-brand h3 and .benafits.cost h3
- Once more for .benafits-lead img .benafits-brand img and .benafits.cost img
- Removed multiple non-necessary classes and combined .search-engine-optimization .online-reputation-management and .social-media-marketing together since they are the same - and classified them as main-content
- Same as above but with .search-engine-optimization img .online-reputation-management img and .social-media-marketing img
- Same as above but with .search-engine-optimization h2 .online-reputation-management h2 and .social-media-marketing h2
- Added CSS comments for further understanding
- Replaced div in respect to section name types
- Changed the order of the benafits and main-content sections in CSS to follow the HTML top down flow

# How To Use:
- Navigate the website via the navigation options in the top right or by scrolling. You can also access the main website page via the Horiseon header if additional pages were to be added in the future.

# Code Style:
To help understand sections better I like to leave a space bettween two obvious, or what I feel to be important sections as a way to easily and visually find the header, body, footer etc... like the example below. 
</head>
<!-- End Head and HTML Requisites -->

<!-- Body -->
<body>
